This project presents a comprehensive **Supply Chain Management (SCM) Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**, aimed at tracking, analyzing, and optimizing critical supply chain metrics such as inventory levels, supplier performance, order fulfillment, transportation efficiency, and costs.

> 📌 While the original guideline suggested Tableau, this version has been fully implemented in **Power BI** to demonstrate interactive and business-focused reporting using Microsoft’s ecosystem.
